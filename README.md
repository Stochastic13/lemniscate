# lemniscate
Parallel Arbitrary Precision Algorithm for Color Fractal Rendering

![build workflow](https://github.com/Stochastic13/lemniscate/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Stay tuned for updates. Approximate date of the first release with usable, polished code: 20 August 2022

Things that lemniscate can do:
1. Fast arbitrary-precision mandelbrot calculations
2. Calculate for a static image or a progressively zooming series of images
3. Custom coloring algorithms with color transfer
